# SRE Assistant powered by ClickHouse and Hasura

## Introduction 
Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) are entrusted with the critical task of minimizing downtime and disruptions, often requiring them to navigate through a deluge of data flowing in from all directions. However, the stress and pressure of these scenarios and the overwhelming influx of data and signals can hamper an SRE's effectiveness and result in a cascade of service interruptions.


In this project we build a SRE assistant using Large Language Model from OpenAI to quickly understand get quick summary of Issue / Incident.
